# EX 2A BACKTRACKING - RAT IN MAZE PROBLEM
## DATE:
## AIM:
To implement the Rat in a Maze problem using backtracking and find all possible paths from the start to the destination in a given maze.


## Algorithm
1.Start from the initial cell (0, 0) and create a solution matrix to track the path.
2.Check if the current cell is safe to move into (i.e., within bounds and not a wall).
3.Mark the current cell in the solution path if it is safe.
4.Recursively try moving right or down to reach the destination (N-1, N-1).
5.Backtrack if no path forward, unmark the cell, and return False if no solution is found.
